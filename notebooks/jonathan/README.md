## 9/18 - 9/24

Tuesday:
Meeting with TA
Second conversation with Machine shop

Sunday: 
Worked on project proposal revision
Worked on design document 
Finalized block diagram design

## 9/25 - 10/01

Ordered 12V DC motors, with 10:1 Gearbox
Ordered and researched on weight sensors
Worked on design document

## 10/02 - 10/08

Gave ideas for machine shop to finalize
Researched what was needed for the schematics

## 10/09 - 10/15

Worked on schematics. 

## 10/16 - 10/22

Worked on layout.

## 10/23 - 10/30

Sent out order for PCB
Sent out order for components

## 11/6 - 11/12

Soldered:

  power system
    Had issues with LM317, resistor values over 1k ohms skew calculations for output voltage
    Had to trial and error our resistors to get voltage within spec for MCU
    
  H-Bridge
    Accidentally tested board with power before finishing soldering. Shorted 5V and GND
    
  ESP32

-Decided to give up on USB to UART Bridge

## 11/13 - 11/19

Soldered: 

  USB connection
  
    layout didn't match part entirely, pins don't solder properly
    manually soldered pins directly to PCB with wires
    
  HX711 system
  
    Took out components from module board
    Fixed some traces on PCB
    Put components on PCB
    
  Odor system
  
    Soldered wires and resistors 
    calibration test failed

## 11/20 - 11/26

  Stuff kept breaking, messed up 3 or 4 boards prior to final board
  
  Put together everything
  
  Tested final board

## 11/27 - 12/3

Final Demo

Worked on presentation ppt

## 12/4 - 12/9

Final Presentation
