## 09/11-09/17

- First TA meeting 
- Project Proposal
- Conversation with Machine Shop

## 09/18-09/24

- Second TA meeting
- Second conversation with Machine Shop
- CAD modeling of the Litter Box
- Revising Proposal

## 09/25-10/01
- Third TA meeting
- Finished the design document
- Drew the three-view drawing of the cat litter box, including the main dimensions and position of the comb

## 10/02-10/08

- Finished design review 
- Did research on odor sensors, chose and ordered MiCS-5914 as the sensor to detect ammonia concentration

## 10/09-10/15

- Did research on ESP32 programming
- Set up ESP-IDF SDK and Eclipse IDE

## 10/16-10/22

- Confirmed the connection method of each pin of the odor sensor on the PCB
- Conducted tests on the LM317 voltage regulator using an oscilloscope to successfully obtain 3.3V and 5V DC outputs
- Rewrited Design Document
## 10/23-10/29

- Researched and identified the ideal load resistance range (820 to 1164 ohms) for our project based on mathematical calculations.
- Integrated the MiCS-5914 odor sensor with a breadboard and used SCOPY for voltage measurements. Exposed to ammonia in a humid environment, the sensor's output remained safely below 3.3V, confirming the ESP32 microcontroller's compatibility.
- Finished Individual Progress Report

## 10/30-11/5

- Nothing particular. Still waiting for the components to come in order to perform further tests.

## 11/6-11/12

- finished the code for odor sensor (ADC module).
