# 09/19 Meeting Notes

## Changes to the proposal

1. Automatic litter box is the problem (not odor, ...)
2. Be specific how the phone app will function (wifi/bluetooth? control? notification?)
3. Mark the voltages on the red lines in the block diagram
4. RV table (requirement-verification)
5. Motor current analysis (example on ECE445 wiki)
6. Safety concerns (step down from 110V...)
7. Refer to the rubric

## Raking system

1. Make holes in the comb big enough for less resistance
2. Just need to push the sand to the edge
3. The edge is either removable or has a slot (or both?)
4. The comb does not reach the bottom of the sand
